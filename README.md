# IITK Coin

- ### Subpackages
  - My package is split into multiple sub-packages (i.e. I have made a few sub-directories - `global`, `handlers`, `server` and `database`).

- ### Write-Ahead Log
  - The `journal_mode` is set to `WAL` because of its [advantages](https://sqlite.org/wal.html#overview) over the default, `DELETE` mode in SQLite.
  - I personally tested in both modes and observed that the `WAL` mode works slightly faster (upto 10x faster) than the default mode while processing **parallelly requested** write operations into the database.
  - I also tested both the modes (again using parallel curl commands) intentionally keeping the DB locked for a certain time. In the default mode the concurrent requests are bound to be unsuccessful with an `database is locked` error. But, in `WAL` mode requests are handled sequentially and automatically once the db gets unlocked.

- ### Testing
  I have used this script - http://p.ip.fi/Kb_e to test the endpoints.

- ### Common Response Method
  Although the endpoints have slightly different formats for their response object, all of them are handled using a `type-switch` in a common `server.Respond()` function which responds to requests for all the endpoints. This method has been used a lot of times in various files. It has greatly reduced the bulkiness of codes in individual files.

- ### HTTP Status Codes
  A suitable http status code is assigned to every response.

- ### Database
  I have used two database management systems in this application, `SQLite` and `Redis`. The `init()` function of the `database` package automatically initializes the databases. The initialization errors are handled before making any other database operations.

- ### .env
  - The `.env` file contains the `Secret Key` to sign the JWT, the variable `Maximum Cap` for the coins and the variable `Minimum Events` which is a for users to be eligible for transactions. It is deliberately left out of `.gitignore` for the purposes of checking.
  - If an `.env` file is not found the defult values of these environment variables will be used throughout.
  - My intention was to make it convenient for one who is running the backend to be able to update these varibles in the `.env` file without having to search for them in the code. And I have made it so that, if these environment variables are updated here these values will be overwritten to the variables defined inside the code.
  - There is also a file named `.env.dev` that contains a the gmailid and password for a test account from which all OTPs are sent.

- ### Access Token
  Expiry Time is currently set to 30 minutes.

- ### Refresh Token (or similar)
  To be implemented soon.

- ### Cap for Maximum Coins
  Currently set to `10001` coins.

- ### Minimum Events
  Currently set to `6`.

- ### Redeem  
  The functionalities currently available are:<br />
  - Users can send redeem requests which will be in pending state by default. This is present in the `/redeems/new` endpoint. Once a valid request is made, an OTP is send to the user's emailid (that was collected during signup).
  - An Admin can see a list of all pending redeem requests on the `/redeems` endpoint
  - Users can see the status of all their requests on the `/redeems` endpoint
  - An Admin can "Accept" or "Reject" a redeem request on the `/redeems/update`endpoint

- ### OTP
  - `OTP` based confirmation systems are implemented on the `/redeems/new` and the `/transfer`. The respective OTPs will have to be POSTed on the endpoints `/redeems/new/confirm` and `/transfer/confirm`.
  - There is also a `Resend OTP` option available (only at the confirmation endpoints). If a user wants to get another OTP, they have to POST a request with `resend` value set to `true`.

- ### The Process of Confirmation
  1. The user sends a request (on one of the endpoints - `/redeems/new` or `/transfer`)
  1. If the request is invalid the server responds with the messages and errors
  1. If the request is valid -
      - An OTP is generated.
      - The OTP along with the data that needs to be stored in the required tables is temporarily saved in the `Redis` database. Expiry time is set to 2 mins currently.
      - The OTP is sent to the user's emailid.
      - If the correct OTP is not entered, the process ends with an error message unless the user sets the `resend` option to be true.
        - If the resend option is true, one can enter the OTP again with a new POST request on the same endpoint
      - If the OTP is successfully entered and there is no error while storing the data in the required tables
        - Immediately, the data along with the OTP is deleted from the `Redis` database.
      - If no request is made within this expiry time of 2 mins (not even a resend), the main data to be stored is lost
  
  *One can potentially delay the process (of transfer/redeem) if they keep on resending the OTP before the current one expires. But, this can be done until the `JWT` token expires, after which the user has to login again.*

---
### For my reference:
- [x] look up popular directory structures
- [x] send a json object in the response for every endpoint
- [x] use MDN: HTTP status codes -> http.StatusBadRequest, http.StatusUnauthorized, ...
- [x] batch, txn depends on batch
- [X] make redeem_coins endpts.
- [X] implement OTP
- [X] Use Redis
- [ ] use other modes of transaction - `IMMEDIATE`, `EXCLUSIVE`
- [ ] use refresh token/similar
- [ ] check isAdmin from token and then authorize to /secretPage
- [ ] a new table `auth` for storing just rollnos and passwords?
- [ ] keep checking for unhandled errors

#### Some incredibly helpful resources

> A common approach for invalidating tokens when a user changes their password is to sign the token with a hash of their password. Thus if the password changes, any previous tokens automatically fail to verify. You can extend this to logout by including a last-logout-time in the user's record and using a combination of the last-logout-time and password hash to sign the token. This requires a DB lookup each time you need to verify the token signature, but presumably you're looking up the user anyway.\

**In which line is the DB actually locked in the default (`DEFERRED`) mode?**

  An sqlite DB is locked after one of the write statements (e.g. `UPDATE`, `INSERT`, ...) are executed, irrespective of whether they are in a transaction. This is the default behaviour.
