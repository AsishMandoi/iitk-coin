# IITK Coin

I have split my package into multiple sub-packages (i.e. I have made a few sub-directories - `global`, `server`, `handlers` and `database`).

I have defined some variables and struct types, to be used in other functions in the **`global`** package. This package does not depend on any other package. Also, for the response format for each endpoint, you can refer to this `global` package.

The requests format for each endpoint is specified in the beginning of each of the handler functions.

Although the endpoints have slightly different format for their response object, I have handled them all using a `type-switch` in a common server.Respond function which responds to requests for all the endpoints.

In order to access /secretpage please provide an authorization token in the **header** in this format --> "Authorization: Bearer \<access token\>".

Deliberately left `.env` out of `.gitignore` for the purposes of checking.

### For my reference:
- [x] look up popular directory structures
- [x] send a json object in the response
- [x] use MDN: HTTP status codes -> http.StatusBadRequest, http.StatusUnauthorized
- [ ] use refresh token
- [ ] A common approach for invalidating tokens when a user changes their password is to sign the token with a hash of their password. Thus if the password changes, any previous tokens automatically fail to verify. You can extend this to logout by including a last-logout-time in the user's record and using a combination of the last-logout-time and password hash to sign the token. This requires a DB lookup each time you need to verify the token signature, but presumably you're looking up the user anyway. â€“ [Travis Terry](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/21978658/invalidating-json-web-tokens/23089839#comment45057142_23089839)
- [ ] (opt) check isAdmin from token and then authorize to /secretPage
- [ ] keep checking for unhandled errors
- [ ] a new table `auth` for storing just rollnos and passwords?
