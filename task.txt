Task

1. Create web server with two endpoints /login and /signup that accepts POST requests.

2. The /signup endpoint will receive a new user's roll no, password and other details and
create a new user in the database. You already have created a function earlier to add users
to the database. Don't store the password as plain text. Apply hashing and salting.

3. The /login endpoint will take in the rollno and password and if verified successfully
will return a JWT (JSON Web Token) as part of the response.

4. Create an endpoint, say /secretpage that returns some dummy data only if the user is
logged in. By logged in here we mean that the JWT sent along the request should be a valid
token and the user is authorized to access the endpoint.
